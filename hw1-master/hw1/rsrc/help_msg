USAGE: bin/fliki [-h] [-n] [-q] DIFF_FILE
   -h       Help: displays this help menu.
   -n       Dry run: no patched output is produced.
   -q       Quiet mode: no error output is produced.

If -h is specified, then it must be the first option on the command line, and any
other options are ignored.

If -h is not specified, then a filename DIFF_FILE must be the last argument.  In this case,
the program reads the DIFF_FILE, which is assumed to be in the traditional format
produced by 'diff' and it applies the edits specified therein to lines of text read
from stdin.  The patched result is written to stdout and any error reports are written
to stderr.

If the program succeeds in applying all the patches without any errors, then it exits
with exit code EXIT_SUCCESS.  Otherwise, the program exits with EXIT_FAILURE after issuing
an error report on stderr.  In case of an error, the output that is produced on stdout may
be truncated at the point at which the error was detected.

If the -n option is specified, then the program performs a 'dry run' in which only error
reports are produced (on stderr) and no patched output is produced on stdout.

If the -q option is specified, then the program does not produce any error reports on
stderr, although it still exits with EXIT_FAILURE should an error occur.
